<h1>Launching an EC2 instance</h1>
Step 1: Launch an instance
You can launch a Linux instance using the AWS Management Console as described in the following procedure. This tutorial is intended to help you quickly launch your first instance, so it doesn't cover all possible options. For information about advanced options, see Launch an instance using the new launch instance wizard. For information about other ways to launch your instance, see Launch your instance.

To launch an instance
Open the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.

From the EC2 console dashboard, in the Launch instance box, choose Launch instance, and then choose Launch instance from the options that appear.

Under Name and tags, for Name, enter a descriptive name for your instance.

Under Application and OS Images (Amazon Machine Image), do the following:

Choose Quick Start, and then choose Amazon Linux. This is the operating system (OS) for your instance.

From Amazon Machine Image (AMI), select an HVM version of Amazon Linux 2. Notice that these AMIs are marked Free tier eligible. An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a basic configuration that serves as a template for your instance.

Under Instance type, from the Instance type list, you can select the hardware configuration for your instance. Choose the t2.micro instance type, which is selected by default. The t2.micro instance type is eligible for the free tier. In Regions where t2.micro is unavailable, you can use a t3.micro instance under the free tier. For more information, see AWS Free Tier.

Under Key pair (login), for Key pair name, choose the key pair that you created when getting set up.
